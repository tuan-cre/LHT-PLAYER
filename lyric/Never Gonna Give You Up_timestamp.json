Desert you
0:23
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
0:23
Hurt you
0:23
We're no strangers to love
0:25
You know the rules and so do I
0:27
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
0:30
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
0:33
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
0:38
Gotta make you understand
0:41
Never gonna give you up
0:41
Never gonna let you down
0:44
Never gonna run around and desert you
0:46
Never gonna make you cry
0:49
Never gonna say goodbye
0:51
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
1:01
We've known each other for so long
1:04
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
1:10
Inside, we both know what's been going on
1:19
We know the game, and we're gonna play it
1:22
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
1:29
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
1:32
Never gonna give you up
1:33
Never gonna let you down
1:36
Never gonna run around and desert you
1:39
Never gonna make you cry
1:41
Never gonna say goodbye
1:44
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
1:48
Never gonna give you up
1:49
Never gonna let you down
1:52
Never gonna run around and desert you
1:54
Never gonna make you cry
1:57
Never gonna say goodbye
2:02
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
